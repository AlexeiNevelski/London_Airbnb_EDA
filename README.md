## Goals

In my work I wanted to find answers on the following questions:

- Are there any significant correlation between quantitative metrics?
- What are the most popular room types?
- What are the most popular neighbourhoods?
- How does the price change depending on room type and neighbourhood?
- How does the number of reviews change depending on room type and neighbourhood?
- What type of property dominates in each neighbourhood?
- How does the availability change depending on room type and neighbourhood?
- How does the hosts' listings count change depending on room type and neighbourhood?
- How many hosts have different types of property?
